You take two inputs:

                    raw_obabel      : directory where raw babel svg placed
                    parsed_obabel   : directory where to store parsed and structured obabel svg
                    r_png           : where to store returned png



raw_obabel                  |---a.txt
        |---------------A---|---b.txt
        |                   |---x.txt
        |
        |
        |---------------B----(same as A)




Short : make one folder  which must contain r_obabe, p_obabel, r_png folders.......


Extra:
        get name of all folders in raw_obabel
        then iteratively enter each folder
            with in that folder , parse all .txt files and store in parsed_obabel, with the same folder name and file
            name



        keep record of all files parsed in log directory
        so that in case of failure of any file parsing it is not in log file and we can delete its output folder or file
        cause it will be corrupt





CAVEATS :

1-if the file you want to check existence if has a folder with same name(extension in folder name)
then file check fails!

2-Insert content at specific point in text file without needing to copy huge amount of data first
 and then writing it back




 NOTES :


  Directory must be like
    root/p_obabel
    root/r_obabel
    root/r_png


 feed_png_maker takes root directory
 feed_parser takes root directory

 parser parses one file, feed parser make a pipeline and parses every file in every destination folder automatically
 png_maker convert one entire text file into images, whereas feed_png_maker make a pipeline and make images out of all
 files in all desired folders
